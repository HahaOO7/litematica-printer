# Litematica-Printer

## Setup

To set this up just add the latest litematica version to your mods folder as well as this, it will replace easy place with printer. If carpet extra /quickcarpet enabled accurateblockplacement, you can turn on option, and... here goes the overpowered printer.

## Install guide

Install fabric (well, use MultiMC), litematica, malilib, and put this into mods folder. then you can just use easyplace. 

## Settings

`easyPlaceModeHoldEnabled`:&emsp;	"When enabled, then simply holding down the use key and looking at different schematic blocks will place them"<br/>

`signTextPaste`:&emsp;				"Automatically set the text in the sign GUIs from the schematic"<br/>

## TODO List (most possible to least possible)
Water placement - should be done with ice placement and request breaking.

Waterlogged block placement - will be placed when water source is there because it will automatically waterlog it

Fix block "face" rounding(rotation) issue, due to player rotation while using right click. 

Sorter item filling - not likely
